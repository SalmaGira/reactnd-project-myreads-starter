# MyReads Project

This is a react project that shows three shleves for storing books to a user, Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. The user can choose the where to put a book, or change the shelf of a book at any time. The user also can switch to a search page to search for other books with title or authors of books and adds any book to any shelf wanted.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
